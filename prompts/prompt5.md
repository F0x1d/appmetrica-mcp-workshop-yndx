You have a complete AppMetrica MCP Server implementation. Now create comprehensive documentation, build the project, and perform final polish to make it production-ready.

REQUIREMENTS:
Create complete documentation files, build the project, and ensure everything is ready for deployment.

SPECIFIC TASKS:

1. CREATE comprehensive README.md with:

     * Crash Analysis: Get crashes by time interval or specific crash group ID
     * Event Tracking: Retrieve user session events by time interval and optionally filter by device ID
     * Async Handling: Automatically handles AppMetrica's asynchronous responses with intelligent retry logic
     * Secure Configuration: Uses environment variables for credentials (no hardcoded tokens)
     * Comprehensive Field Support: Access to all available AppMetrica API fields
   - ## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools section with detailed documentation for get_crashes and get_events tools
   - Complete list of all 30 crash fields
   - Complete list of all 32 event fields
   - ## üîß Setup section with installation and environment variable instructions
   - ## üîí Security section covering credential management and best practices
   - ## üîÑ Async Processing section explaining retry logic (10 seconds, 100 retries)
   - ## üìù Usage Examples with sample queries
   - ## üèóÔ∏è Architecture section listing TypeScript, MCP SDK, Axios, Zod, Environment Variables
   - ## üìÅ Project Structure with complete file tree and descriptions
   - ## üèóÔ∏è Code Organization explaining each module's purpose
   - ## ü§ù Contributing section with modification instructions
   - ## üìã API Reference with endpoints and authentication details

2. CREATE detailed SETUP.md with:
   - # AppMetrica MCP Server Setup Guide title
   - ## Overview section describing the server's purpose
   - ## Features section listing main capabilities
   - ## Secure Configuration section explaining environment variable approach
   - ## Required Environment Variables section:
     * APPMETRICA_OAUTH_TOKEN: Your AppMetrica OAuth token
     * APPMETRICA_APPLICATION_ID: Your AppMetrica application ID
   - ## Setting Environment Variables section with three methods:
     * Option 1: Shell profile method (recommended) with ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile examples
     * Option 2: .env file method for development with security warning
     * Option 3: Temporary export method for testing
   - ## Getting AppMetrica Credentials section with step-by-step instructions:
     * OAuth Token: AppMetrica web interface ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API keys
     * Application ID: AppMetrica web interface ‚Üí Select application ‚Üí Application settings
   - ## Available Tools section with detailed parameter documentation and examples
   - ## Testing the Server section with sample queries
   - ## Troubleshooting section covering common setup issues
   - ## Security Notes emphasizing credential protection best practices

3. CREATE comprehensive TROUBLESHOOTING.md with:
   - # AppMetrica MCP Server - Troubleshooting Guide title
   - ## Common Issues and Solutions section covering:
     * ### 1. MCP Error -32000: Connection closed
       - Causes: missing executable, environment variables, dependencies
       - Solutions: build verification, environment variable checks, manual testing
     * ### 2. Module Not Found Errors
       - Cause: missing dependencies or incorrect build
       - Solution: clean install and rebuild steps
     * ### 3. TypeScript Compilation Errors
       - Cause: missing TypeScript or type definitions
       - Solution: TypeScript installation and rebuild
     * ### 4. API Authentication Errors
       - Cause: invalid OAuth token or Application ID
       - Solutions: credential verification steps
     * ### 5. Server Configuration Issues
       - MCP settings location and configuration verification
     * ### 6. Restart Requirements
   - ## Testing the Server section with functionality tests
   - ## Debug Mode section with detailed logging instructions
   - ## Getting Help section with troubleshooting steps
   - ## File Structure Verification with complete project tree
   - Each issue must include detailed cause explanations, multiple solutions, code examples, and verification steps

4. VALIDATE the project:
   - Test server startup with dummy credentials: APPMETRICA_OAUTH_TOKEN="test" APPMETRICA_APPLICATION_ID="test" npm run dev
   - Verify output: "AppMetrica MCP server running on stdio"
   - Test that tsx runs TypeScript files directly without compilation

5. FINAL VALIDATION checklist:
   - ‚úÖ All TypeScript files are properly structured
   - ‚úÖ All imports resolve correctly with .ts extensions
   - ‚úÖ Package.json scripts work correctly (dev, watch, inspector)
   - ‚úÖ Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
   - ‚úÖ No hardcoded credentials anywhere in codebase
   - ‚úÖ .gitignore properly protects sensitive files
   - ‚úÖ Server starts successfully and responds to stdio
   - ‚úÖ All 30 crash fields and 32 event fields documented correctly
   - ‚úÖ Security best practices implemented and documented

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Use proper Markdown formatting with emojis for section headers
- Include syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Provide step-by-step instructions for all procedures
- Cover all edge cases and common issues with detailed solutions
- Include security warnings and best practices throughout
- Provide complete API field lists with proper formatting
- Include realistic usage examples and sample queries
- Document all configuration options and environment variables

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Professional documentation quality suitable for production use
- Complete coverage of all features and functionality
- Clear troubleshooting guidance for common issues
- Security-first approach with credential protection emphasis
- Production-ready standards with comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly instructions for developers of all skill levels

The result should be a complete, professional, production-ready MCP server project with comprehensive documentation that enables anyone to successfully deploy, configure, and use the AppMetrica integration.
